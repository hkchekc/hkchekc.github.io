### <span style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Supplier Search and Market Concentration [JMP]</span> <!-- [Draft](assets/doc/CHOI_JMP_draft.pdf) -->

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract </strong></summary>
Abstract: This paper examines how lower search costs in input markets reshape the distribution of firm sizes. Using Swedish administrative data, I document four facts: (i) more productive firms pay lower input prices, (ii) the dispersion in imported varieties across firms is widening, (iii) the sales distribution among importers has become more unequal, and (iv) municipalities with greater fiber-optic coverage experience faster supplier network growth, especially among more productive firms. To interpret these patterns, I develop a quantitative model of monopolistic competition with frictional input markets, in which firms incur fixed costs to search and bargain with suppliers. The model shows that falling search costs reallocate resources toward importers, raising aggregate productivity but also increasing market concentration. A counterfactual exercise indicates that a 10 percent tariff on inputs would largely offset these gains.

<summary><strong>Abstract </strong></summary>
Abstract: Auclert et al. (2024) recently argued that, to first order, menu-costs models deliver
the same New Keynesian Phillips Curves as time-dependent models in response to AR(1)
shocks. We show here that when considering a broader class of shocks, menu-costs models
can generate qualitatively and quantitatively different Phillips curves than implied by
time-dependent models. Shocks to the growth rate of nominal demand generate inflation
persistence in the model, in line with the data, but at odd with the standard time-
dependent NKPC. Changes in the extensive margin of price adjustment in the menu-cost
model generate history dependence that is captured by the lagged inflation rate. Once
we control for lagged nominal demand growth, the explanatory power of lagged inflation
drops significantly. The reason is that nominal demand growth is a second determinant
of inflation in the Phillips curve in menu-cost models and inflation therefore inherits the persistence of the process for nominal demand.

### <span style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">When Unified Market Meets Local Markets: How Big Firms Drive Local Price Dynamics?</span>


<!--Abstract:Firms compete with each other in many different markets - labor market as employers, consumer market as sellers or input market as buyers. Recent research have studied competition in one or more of these market. However, these markets differ in terms of structure and geographical characteristics. The true competition intensity is thus complex and depends on interaction of these different markets. In this paper, I use balance sheet data at both the firm and plant levels from the Swedish retail industry. I construct several measures of market concentration, including the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), profit margins, the concentration ratio of the top three firms (CR3), and others. I then analyze the time trends of these measures at both the national and local (municipality) levels. To interpret these findings, I develop a quantitative model that features a locally segmented labor and final goods market, alongside a nationally unified intermediate goods market.-->
