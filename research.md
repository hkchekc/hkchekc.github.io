Abstract: This paper studies how changes in input market frictions reshape firm size distribution and aggregate productivity.  
I develop a quantitative model of supplier search in which firms incur fixed costs to find and bargain with input suppliers.  
The framework provides a microfoundation for how input trade affect firm performance and resource allocation.  
Empirical evidence from firm-level import data motivates the model through four key patterns: (i) the dispersion in the number of imported varieties across firms has widened, (ii) the sales distribution among importers has become more unequal, (iii) larger firms pay lower input prices, and (iv) firms in municipalities with better digital infrastructure expand their supplier networks faster, especially for larger firms.  
In general equilibrium, reductions in input search frictions reallocate resources toward more productive importers, raising real GDP by 9 percent but also increasing market concentration by 6.6 percent.  
A counterfactual analysis shows that a 10 percent tariff on imported inputs would largely offset these gains while reducing market concentration.

Abstract: Mainstream analyses of automation often treat capital as a homogeneous input
and focus narrowly on industrial robots. We use matched Swedish administrative
microdata linking firms, workers, and imports to study how heterogeneous forms
of capital interact with labor and firm performance. First, we replicate the main
findings of Acemoglu et al. (2020) for Sweden and confirm that robot adoption
has similar effects on firms’ value added, employment, and workforce composition.
Second, we extend the empirical setting to capture heterogeneous effects by firm
size and the value of robot adoption. Third, we apply the same framework to a
broad range of disaggregated capital goods identified at the 8-digit product level.
We find that several non-robot capital types have effects on labor and productivity
comparable to those of robots, while aggregated capital measures tend to yield
weak results. Finally, we classify capital goods by how they interact with
different categories of labor, such as by education, gender, and age. Our findings
suggest that although robots have large and visible impacts on labor markets, they
are not unique in their economic function, and their interaction patterns with labor
resemble those of older and more conventional capital-embodied technologies.

Abstract: Auclert et al. (2024) recently argued that, to first order, menu-costs models deliver
the same New Keynesian Phillips Curves as time-dependent models in response to AR(1)
shocks. We show here that when considering a broader class of shocks, menu-costs models
can generate qualitatively and quantitatively different Phillips curves than implied by
time-dependent models. Shocks to the growth rate of nominal demand generate inflation
persistence in the model, in line with the data, but at odd with the standard time-
dependent NKPC. Changes in the extensive margin of price adjustment in the menu-cost
model generate history dependence that is captured by the lagged inflation rate. Once
we control for lagged nominal demand growth, the explanatory power of lagged inflation
drops significantly. The reason is that nominal demand growth is a second determinant
of inflation in the Phillips curve in menu-cost models and inflation therefore inherits the persistence of the process for nominal demand.
