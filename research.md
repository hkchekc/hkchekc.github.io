### Loss From Trade: Trends of Price Dispersion in Intermediate Good Market and Misallocation

Abstract: Substantial input price dispersion had been recently documented in several different contexts. I observe the same dispersion in Swedish import data, propose potential causes and document correlations between input price gap and economics outcome. I also find that the price dispersion has been increasing in recent years. One possible explanation for this is the decreasing trade cost. I build a quantitative model, featuring search-and-bargaining between buyers and supplier, to draw output implications of my empirical findings. In the baseline model, I find that the losses from misallocation increase with decreasing search cost.

### Inflation Persistence and a new Phillips Curve 
#### with Marcus Hagedorn, Juan Llavador & Kurt Mitman
Abstract: Auclert et al. (2024) recently argued that, to first order, menu-costs models deliver
the same New Keynesian Phillips Curves as time-dependent models in response to AR(1)
shocks. We show here that when considering a broader class of shocks, menu-costs models
can generate qualitatively and quantitatively different Phillips curves than implied by
time-dependent models. Shocks to the growth rate of nominal demand generate inflation
persistence in the model, in line with the data, but at odd with the standard time-
dependent NKPC. Changes in the extensive margin of price adjustment in the menu-cost
model generate history dependence that is captured by the lagged inflation rate. Once
we control for lagged nominal demand growth, the explanatory power of lagged inflation
drops significantly. The reason is that nominal demand growth is a second determinant
of inflation in the Phillips curve in menu-cost models and inflation therefore inherits the
persistence of the process for nominal demand.
